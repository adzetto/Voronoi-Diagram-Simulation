# Voronoi-Diagram-Simulation
 
The purpose of this project is to build the Voronoi cell that corresponds to a point at the origin using a set of points that are evenly distributed over a plane. As part of this procedure, we will make points, determine distances, locate the Voronoi cell, and finally, visualise the data.
