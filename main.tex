    This project's goal is to use a collection of uniformly distributed points on a plane to construct the Voronoi cell that corresponds to a point at the origin. Making points, finding distances, finding the Voronoi cell, and then visualising the data are all part of this process. Our research shows how to do this in Python and identifies its strengths and weaknesses as a practical tool.

    An animation package called Manim was used to produce a simulation that would further show how the Voronoi diagram was generated. You can see the process of building the Voronoi cell for a point at the origin in this simulation.

\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose}
The main goal of this project is to make the Voronoi cell that goes with a point at the origin in a plane that is filled with randomly placed points. The project includes several important steps: picking random points, figuring out how far these points are from the starting point, deciding where the edges of the Voronoi cell will be, and finally, showing the Voronoi cell on a graph. The study aims to give a full picture of the geometric features of Voronoi graphs and how they can be used in real life.


\section{Motivation}
There are many uses for voronoi diagrams in many fields, such as computer science, biology, and geography. They are an important part of computational geometry. The need to understand the academic and practical sides of these geometric shapes is what led to this project. In the area of computer science, Voronoi maps are used in images, location analysis, and methods for finding the shortest path. In geography, they are used to make maps and plan spaces, and in biology, they can be used to make models of cell structures and regions. By using a Voronoi model, this project aims to help people understand these uses better and lay the groundwork for more study and development.

\section{Aim}
The project's goal is to create a Python programme that can randomly place points in a plane, find the Voronoi cell that corresponds to a point at the origin, and draw that cell. To correctly calculate and see the Voronoi cell, this requires using a number of different computer methods and programmes.

\section{Objectives}
To achieve the aim of this project, the following specific objectives have been established:
\begin{itemize}
  \item To generate a set of randomly distributed points within a two-dimensional plane.
  \item To compute the distances from each of these points to a fixed point at the origin.
  \item To determine the boundaries of the Voronoi cell associated with the origin based on the calculated distances.
  \item To visualize the Voronoi cell along with the randomly generated points using appropriate plotting techniques.
\end{itemize}

\section{Scope}
Python and its tools, such as numpy and matplotlib, will be used in this project to make Voronoi diagrams and show them. Using this method, random points are made in polar coordinates, then they are changed to Cartesian coordinates and the Voronoi cell for the origin is calculated. For a better understanding of the Voronoi cell's structure, the results of this application will be shown in image form. This project is mostly about making a simple solution for a fixed point at the origin, but the methods and results can be used in more complicated situations with bigger datasets and different point distributions, which means the study can be used in more areas.


\section{Significance}
For many useful situations, it is important to know how Voronoi models are put together and what their features are. This project not only helps students learn how to understand geometric shapes, but it also lays the groundwork for more advanced uses in science and business. The study's findings can be used to make the best use of space resources, make computer programmes run faster, and create better models of nature events. These findings will greatly assist progress in both the theory and applied sciences.

\chapter{Literature Review}

\section{Background History}

An essential building block of computational geometry, voronoi diagrams divide a plane into separate areas according to their distance from a predetermined set of points called generators. So, let \( P = \{p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n\} \subset \mathbb{R}^2 \) be a set of \( n \) distinct points. The Voronoi cell \( V(p_i) \) associated with the generator \( p_i \in P \) is defined as:
\[
V(p_i) = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^2 \mid \forall j \neq i, \|x - p_i\| \leq \|x - p_j\| \}
\]
where \( \|\cdot\| \) denotes the Euclidean norm. These regions, or cells, have broad applicability across multiple disciplines.

\section{Related Works}

Theoretical developments and practical uses of voronoi diagrams are covered extensively in the literature. Some notable innovations include iterative methods for building centroidal Voronoi tessellations (CVTs) and algorithms for efficient calculation of Voronoi diagrams (e.g., Fortune's sweepline algorithm). Let \( \Omega \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2 \) be a domain, and let \( \rho: \Omega \to \mathbb{R} \) be a density function. The objective in constructing a CVT is to find a set of points \( P \subset \Omega \) such that each point \( p_i \in P \) is the centroid of its respective Voronoi cell \( V(p_i) \), weighted by \( \rho \). Formally, \( p_i \) must satisfy:
\[
p_i = \frac{\int_{V(p_i)} x \rho(x) \, dx}{\int_{V(p_i)} \rho(x) \, dx}
\]
Geometric models are useful in many fields; for example, spatial analysis may help with location optimisation issues, and the biological sciences can use them to better understand cellular structures and patterns.

\section{Summary \& Discussion}

Voronoi diagrams and their centroidal variations are fundamentally important for studying their computational characteristics and applications. This knowledge makes it easier to create effective algorithms and put them into practice in a variety of real-world contexts.

\chapter{Proposed System Analysis \& Design}

\section{Problem Statement}

Given a point located at the origin \( O \in \mathbb{R}^2 \) and a set of randomly distributed points \( P = \{p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n\} \subset \mathbb{R}^2 \), the task is to determine the Voronoi cell associated with the origin. Formally, we seek to compute the region:
\[
V(O) = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^2 \mid \forall p_i \in P, \|x - O\| \leq \|x - p_i\| \}
\]
This involves generating points, calculating distances, and employing algebraic methods to delineate \( V(O) \).

\section{Analysis}

Python is used to create the points and calculate the required distances. The process of analysis is as follows: first, in polar coordinates, create \( P \). Then, transform it to Cartesian coordinates. Finally, calculate the distances in Euclidean terms from each point in \( P \) to the origin. How is the distance function defined:

\[
d_i = \|p_i - O\| = \sqrt{x_i^2 + y_i^2}
\]
for each \( p_i = (x_i, y_i) \in P \). The Voronoi cell \( V(O) \) is constructed by finding the perpendicular bisectors of the line segments \( [O, p_i] \) and determining their intersections.

\section{Feasibility Study}

\textbf{Technical Feasibility}: No specialised hardware or software is required since the project uses ordinary Python libraries like as \texttt{numpy}, \texttt{matplotlib}, and \texttt{random}.

\textbf{Economic Feasibility}: The cost is minimal, requiring only a computer with Python installed.

\textbf{Behavioral Feasibility}: The project is straightforward and accessible, making it suitable for educational and research purposes.

\section{Requirement Analysis}

The necessary tools include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{Python}: For implementation.
  \item \texttt{numpy}: For numerical computations.
  \item \texttt{matplotlib}: For plotting results.
  \item \texttt{random}: For generating random points.
\end{itemize}

\section{System Design}

The design involves the following steps:

\begin{itemize}

\item[1 |]  Generate random points \( P \) in polar coordinates and convert to Cartesian coordinates.
\item[2 |] Compute distances \( d_i = \|p_i - O\| \) for each \( p_i \in P \).
\item[3 |] Identify the closest points to the origin and calculate the perpendicular bisectors of the segments \( [O, p_i] \).
\item[4 |] Determine the intersection points of these bisectors to form the boundaries of \( V(O) \).
\item[5 |] Plot the points and the Voronoi cell using \texttt{matplotlib}.
\end{itemize}


Mathematically, the perpendicular bisector of \( [O, p_i] \) can be described as:
\[
\text{Bisector}(O, p_i): (x - \frac{x_i}{2}) x_i + (y - \frac{y_i}{2}) y_i = 0
\]
Solving the system of linear equations given by the bisectors will yield the vertices of the Voronoi cell.

\subsection{Point Generation Function}

\subsubsection{Purpose}
The \texttt{generate\_points} function generates a specified number of points within given ranges for the radial and angular coordinates. These points are evenly distributed around the center and are transformed from polar to Cartesian coordinates.

\subsubsection{Arguments \& Returns}
Amount of points to create, denoted as $n$. $r_{min}$ is the smallest radius. the greatest radius, denoted as $r_{max}$. $\theta_{min}$: The angle with the smallest value (of degrees). In degrees, $\theta_{max}$ represents the greatest angle. This function takes an array of tuples as input and returns a new array with the distance from the origin as well as the x and y coordinates of each set.

\caption{Generate Random Points in Polar Coordinates}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Function{generate\_points}{$n, r_{min}, r_{max}, \theta_{min}, \theta_{max}$}
    \State $\mathcal{P} \gets \varnothing$
    \For{$i \gets 1$ to $n$}
        \State $r \gets \text{random.uniform}(r_{min}, r_{max})$
        \State $\theta \gets \text{random.uniform}(\theta_{min}, \theta_{max})$

    \EndFor
    \State \Return $\mathcal{P}$
\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}



\subsubsection{Explanation}

\subsection{Finding the Closest Point Function}

\subsubsection{Purpose}
By removing previously found closest points, the \texttt{find\_closest\_point} function finds the point in a list of points that is closest to a reference point \( P_0 \).

\subsubsection{Arguments \& Returns}
The set of points is denoted by $\mathcal{P}$. Point $P_0$ is the starting point. In earlier rounds, the locations that were determined to be closest were added to the $\mathcal{C}$ list. Finds the point nearest to \( P_0 \) and returns its index and coordinates.

\subsubsection{Algorithm}

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Find the Closest Point}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Function{find\_closest\_point}{$\mathcal{P}, P_0, \mathcal{C}$}
    \State $\mathcal{P}_{\text{array}} \gets \text{array}([\mathbf{p}[:2] \ \text{for} \ \mathbf{p} \in \mathcal{P}])$
    \State $P_{0,\text{array}} \gets \text{array}(P_0)$
    \State $\mathcal{D} \gets \text{array}([\|\mathbf{p} - P_{0,\text{array}}\| \ \text{for} \ \mathbf{p} \in \mathcal{P}_{\text{array}}])$
    \For{$\mathbf{c} \in \mathcal{C}$}
        \If{$\mathbf{c} \in \mathcal{P}$}
            \State $index \gets \text{index}(\mathbf{c})$
            \State $\mathcal{D}[index] \gets \infty$
        \EndIf
    \EndFor
    \State $i_{\text{min}} \gets \text{argmin}(\mathcal{D})$
    \State \Return $(i_{\text{min}}, \mathcal{P}[i_{\text{min}}])$
\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsubsection{Explanation}

Consider the set of points \( \mathbf{p}_i = (x_i, y_i, d_i) \) where each point \( \mathcal{P} \subset \mathbb{R}^2 \times \mathbb{R} \) contains the coordinates and distance from the origin. In prior rounds, the set of points that were determined to be closest was denoted as \( \mathcal{C} \subset \mathcal{P} \) and the reference point was denoted as \( P_0 = (x_0, y_0) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \). Finding the point in \( \mathcal{P} \setminus \mathcal{C} \) that is closest to \( P_0 \) is the goal. The collection of coordinates of points in \( \mathcal{P} \) is defined as the array \( \mathcal{P}_{\text{array}} \).

\[
\mathcal{P}_{\text{array}} = \left\{ \mathbf{p}[:2] \mid \mathbf{p} \in \mathcal{P} \right\}
\]

Let \( P_{0,\text{array}} \) be the array representation of the reference point \( P_0 \):
\[
P_{0,\text{array}} = \text{array}(P_0)
\]

Compute the Euclidean distances \( \mathcal{D} \) from \( P_0 \) to each point in \( \mathcal{P}_{\text{array}} \):
\[
\mathcal{D} = \left\{ \|\mathbf{p} - P_{0,\text{array}}\| \mid \mathbf{p} \in \mathcal{P}_{\text{array}} \right\}
\]

For each point \( \mathbf{c} \in \mathcal{C} \), if \( \mathbf{c} \in \mathcal{P} \), set the corresponding distance in \( \mathcal{D} \) to \( \infty \) to exclude it from consideration:
\[
\text{For each } \mathbf{c} \in \mathcal{C}, \text{ if } \mathbf{c} \in \mathcal{P}, \text{ set } \mathcal{D}[\text{index}(\mathbf{c})] = \infty
\]

Determine the index \( i_{\text{min}} \) of the minimum distance in \( \mathcal{D} \):
\[
i_{\text{min}} = \text{argmin}(\mathcal{D})
\]

Return the index and coordinates of the closest point:
\[
\text{Return } (i_{\text{min}}, \mathcal{P}[i_{\text{min}}])
\]


After selecting all points and setting their distances to infinity, the function finds the one with the smallest Euclidean distance to \( P_0 \) and returns it.

    closest_point_index = np.argmin(distances)
    return closest_point_index, points[closest_point_index]

\subsection{Unit Vector Calculation Function}

\subsubsection{Purpose}
Geometric algorithms that need direction and normalisation rely on the \texttt{find\_unit\_vector} function, which computes the unit vector from one point to another.

\subsubsection{Arguments \& Return}
$P_{\text{from}}$: The starting point. $P_{\text{to}}$: The ending point. Returns the unit vector from $P_{\text{from}}$ to $P_{\text{to}}$.

\subsection{Filtering Points by Dot Product}

\subsubsection{Purpose}
The function \texttt{filter\_points\_by\_dot\_product} is used to sort a list of points so that only those points may be used to create a dot product that is not negative, with relation to a reference vector and a base point. Finding points that are roughly in the same direction as the reference vector from the base point is made easier using this method.

\subsubsection{Arguments \& Returns}
The points to filter are referenced by the list \texttt{points}. Distance from the origin, along with $x$ and $y$, is included in each point's tuple. The starting point for measuring directions is called the base point. * The reference vector is used to compute the dot product. Provides a set of points as an array whose dot product with the reference vector, when measured from the base point, is positive.

Bypassing the starting point, the function iteratively processes all elements in the list. After finding the unit vector that extends from the origin to the present location, it takes the dot product of this vector and the reference vector and keeps the result if it's not negative.

\subsection{Point Selection and Filtering Loop}

\subsubsection{Purpose}
In this code snippet, the closest point to \(P_0\) is chosen from a list of points in an iterative fashion. The remaining points are then filtered according to their dot product with a reference vector, and the process continues until they are all removed.

\begin{algorithmic}[1]

\State \Return $(\mathcal{M}, \mathcal{N})$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsubsection{Explanation}
With the reference point being \( P\_0 \in \mathbb{R}^2 \), let \( \mathcal{C} \subset \mathbb{R}^2 \times \mathbb{R} \) represent the set of nearest points. First, we need to find the midpoints (\( \mathcal{M} = \left\{ \frac{\mathbf{p}[:2] + P\_0}{2} \mid \mathbf{p} \in \mathcal{C} \right\} \) between each point in \( \mathcal{C} \) and \( P\_0 \), which is represented by \( \mathcal{M} \). Then, we must calculate the appropriate normal vectors. Assuming that \( \mathbf{p}[:2] - P\_0 \) is a vector from \( P\_0 \) to \( \mathbf{p} \), determine the vector \( \mathbf{v} \) for each \( \mathbf{p} \in \mathcal{C} \). To acquire the normal vector \( \mathbf{n} \) which is equal to 
\[
\begin{pmatrix} 
-v\_y \\ 
v\_x 
\end{pmatrix} 
\]
rotate \( \mathbf{v} \) by 90 degrees. Then, normalise \( \mathbf{n} \) to get the unit normal \( \hat{\mathbf{n}} \). After that, arrange the normals and midpoints in descending order by sorting the indices based on the angles calculated using the arctangent function, \( \theta = \arctan2(\mathcal{M}[:, 1], \mathcal{M}[:, 0]) \). At last, provide back the normals and sorted midpoints.

\subsubsection{Explanation}
The intersection point of two lines that are described by their midpoints may be found using the \hl{find\_intersection} function. both normals $\mathbf{n}\_1, \mathbf{n}\_2$ and $\mathbf{m}\_1, \mathbf{m}\_2$. The programme uses a bespoke linear solver called \hl{linalg\_solve} to solve a system of linear equations $A \mathbf{x} = b$. In order to resolve the linear system, the \hl{linalg\_solve} function employs Gaussian elimination in conjunction with partial pivoting.

\section{Calculation and Visualization of Intersection Points}

\subsection{Purpose}
Identify important geometric elements, including the junction points of line segments described by their midpoints and normal vectors, and to display these locations graphically.


\subsection{Algorithm for Computing Intersection Points}

With respect to the midpoints, let \(\mathcal{M} = \{\mathbf{m}_1, \mathbf{m}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{m}_n\}\) and the normal vectors, \(\mathcal{N} = \{\mathbf{n}_1, \mathbf{n}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{n}_n\}\). The aim is to find the sites where these midpoints and normals join to produce successive line segments.

Define the set of intersection points \(\mathcal{I}\) as follows:
\[
\mathcal{I} = \{ \mathbf{I}_i \mid \mathbf{I}_i = \text{find\_intersection}(\mathbf{m}_i, \mathbf{n}_i, \mathbf{m}_{i+1}, \mathbf{n}_{i+1}), \, i = 1, \ldots, n \}
\]
where \(\mathbf{m}_{n+1} \equiv \mathbf{m}_1\) and \(\mathbf{n}_{n+1} \equiv \mathbf{n}_1\).

\subsection*{Explanation}

The code determines the intersection locations of line segments defined by sequential midpoints and normals given a collection of midpoints (mathcalM) and normal vectors (mathcalN). By using the \hl{find\_intersection} function, every site of intersection is identified. We use Matplotlib to display the points, which include the original set as well as the nearest points, midpoints, and intersecting points.



\chapter{Application, Advantages \& Limitations}

\section{Applications}
The process of making a Voronoi diagram can be used for many things, such as spatial analysis and geographic mapping, transportation and logistics optimisation problems, and modelling of ecosystems and areas in the natural sciences, like biology and ecology.


\section{Advantages}
A Voronoi diagram is useful in many fields, such as geography, biology, and computer science, and has an easy-to-use method for making them. It shows clearly how points are related to each other in terms of how close they are to each other.


\section{Limitations}
However, there are some problems with the method. For example, when there are a lot of points, it takes a lot of computing power, and the accuracy of the Voronoi cell depends on how well the calculations are done.


\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}

\section{Conclusion}
It is successfully shown in the project how to use randomly placed points to make a Voronoi cell connected to the origin. The application makes the Voronoi map easy to see by showing the connections between points that are close to each other.


\section{Future Work}
In the future, work could be done to make the method work better with bigger datasets, to speed up processes by using parallel processing, and to use the Voronoi diagram generation on real-world datasets for useful purposes.
